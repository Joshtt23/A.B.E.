Î” Ive got three crypto picks to dish out before the weekend. Each of these coins is what I call quality digital assets, aka cryptocurrencies with realworld use, utility, and potential for widespread adoption. My investing strategy is simplebuy up quality digital assets at the lowest prices possible, and dont sell anything until you hit 10X. Stock investors think Im crazy, but Im richer than them. And my Digital Heavyweights track record speaks for itself. The first coin is Cardano ADA, my favorite Layer1 asset that Id expect has at least 5X potential at its current price point of 0.37. The second coin is Cosmos ATOM, another Layer1 coin that is currently offering 20 staking rewards. As for the third coin...

Subscribe now to Forbes CryptoAsset  Blockchain Advisor and successfully navigate the bitcoin and crypto market rollercoaster The bitcoin price has dropped back from yeartodate highs of just over 30,000 per bitcoin, with the ethereum price falling along with iteven as excitement over a possible end to Ripples longrunning legal battle has helped XRP break out. Now, after JPMorgan analysts issued a severe 1.1 trillion warning, the former chief executive of bitcoin and crypto exchange Bitmex Arthur Hayes has predicted a crypto market powder keg could go off as soon as this year.

Youre basically putting this powder keg together of a situation thats going to be exploding in the third and fourth quarter of this year, and I think, ultimately, it will be good for bitcoin, Hayes, who now runs a family office called Maelstrom, told the What Bitcoin Did podcast. It will be quite volatile on the upside and the downside. Bitcoin, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies have cheered U.S. president Joe Bidens debt ceiling deal however, JPMorgan analysts last week warned that crypto and stock markets are now nervously eyeing what will happen when the U.S. Treasury tries to refill its coffers. Hayes, who last year was sentenced to two years of probation after pleading guilty to charges he failed to implement an antimoney laundering AML program at Bitmex, pointed to this years banking crisis and expectations the U.S. government will issue just over 1 trillion in new Treasury bills in coming months, potentially sucking hundreds of billions of dollars from the market, as contributing to the powder keg. Sign up now for CryptoCodexA free, daily newsletter for the cryptocurious The bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last few years, pulling the ethereum price with it. Next year, bitcoin will undergo its fourth socalled halving supply cut and Hayes expects the bitcoin price to surge in its aftermath, as it has done previously. I dont think we get up to 70,000 this year, I think next year is when we cross that barrier, then we get the blow off top 2025, 2026 and then its Armageddon, Hayes said, referring to a significant societal upheaval such as a major war that could cause a mass panic and a selloff of all assets, including bitcoin, ethereum and crypto. It doesnt have to be too straightforward, we just have this situation, we have this tinderbox of too much money, no trust and people trying to eke out a living for themselves, Hayes added.",

        "article": "InvestorPlace  Stock Market News, Stock Advice  Trading Tips Cryptocurrency investing has surged in popularity among growth investors. Thats primarily due to the substantial shortterm return potential this asset class provides, even with a small amount of upfront capital. That said, highgrowth cryptos should be approached with caution. Thats because this sector provides significant risks and challenges other assets dont. For example, there arent any sort of cash flows or other valuation metrics to assess highgrowth cryptos, relative to growth stocks or alternative assets. With that said, were now in a new month, with investors potentially looking to rotate into highergrowth assets. For investors looking to do so among the thousands of highgrowth cryptos out there, this task may be daunting. Here are three top projects I think are worth buying in June 2023. Solana SOLUSD offers a compelling case as a top cryptocurrency for decentralized finance DeFi transactions. With its impressive transaction speed, processing up to 50,000 transactions per second, Solana outperforms Ethereum ETHUSD in this aspect. Some enthusiasts even argue that Solana may surpass Ethereum in terms of superiority over DeFi. Solanas rapid transaction speed surpasses that of Ethereum and traditional financial institutions. Its expanding role in DeFi and digital payments is evident through innovations like Solana Pay, enabling direct transactions between merchants and consumers without intermediaries and zero fees. The popularity of Solana Pay is evident, with over 600 merchants adopting it in just two months. Solanas price has also doubled yeartodate, reflecting its growing appeal. Solana adopts the widely embraced proofofstake validation method, promoting decentralization and energy efficiency. With thousands of independent nodes participating in the validation process, the resource consumption is comparable to a regular internet search. An additional benefit of proof of stake is the opportunity to stake Solana holdings and generate passive income. At the time of writing, Solana registered a 24hour gain, with its price reaching 19.51, a 1.49 increase. Despite this positive movement, SOLs weekly performance remained in the negative territory at 3.26. Id like to see a break above the 20 level, for growth investors and traders to step into this highgrowth crypto. Fantom FTMUSD is a blockchain platform that supports the creation of distributed apps and smart contracts. Its use of directed acyclic graph DAG technology enables faster transactions compared to traditional blockchains, making it wellsuited for gaming and decentralized finance DeFi applications. Investors have been drawn to Fantom due to its unique technology, leading to substantial price growth. Currently trading at around 0.32, the token has surged by 100 since the beginning of 2023. Analysts predict that Fantom will remain within the 0.20 to 0.65 range, but a breakthrough could propel it to 1.20. The platforms success and market conditions will shape Fantoms future. Fantom hosts a thriving ecosystem and SpookySwap, a decentralized exchange, plays a crucial role. With total value locked TVL dominance of over 22, it is a key component of the network, surpassed by only two other projects. Notably, SpookySwaps TVL surpassed that of Avalanche AVAXUSD, at one point. Polygon MATICUSD is a lowcost crypto with immense potential. As a wellstructured layer 2 protocol, it enhances the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly in terms of scalability. By improving transaction speeds and reducing fees, layer 2 protocols like Polygon remain valuable and practical despite Ethereums ongoing challenges. At its current price of around 0.90, Polygon presents an attractive longterm investment opportunity. By improving the speed and costefficiency of Ethereum, Polygon plays a vital role in the DeFi space, positioning itself as a promising asset for future growth. Polygon employs zeroknowledge EVM rollups, a technology that optimizes transaction processing by bundling them together before finalizing them on Ethereum. This unique approach sets Polygon apart from other scaling solutions while maintaining compatibility with Ethereums code, making it an appealing choice for developers. Prominent companies like Starbucks NASDAQSBUX, JP Morgan NYSEJPM, Meta Platforms NASDAQMETA, Nike NYSENKE and Franklin Templeton have embraced Polygons blockchain for their operations. As Ethereums scalability challenges persist, Polygon offers an appealing alternative with lower costs and faster speeds. With Polygons price significantly below its peak, there is potential for longterm gains for investors. On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in SOL.
